# EFI-Dell-Optiplex-7070-RX550-BCM94360-Ventura
This is my first ever repository, its an EFI to use with Dell Optiplex 7070 Small Form Factor with its internal GPU HD630 + a discrete Radeon RX500LP 4Gb Yeston 4x HDMI
Current opencore 0.9.0
My Unit has 2x DP + 1x HDMI Onboard, all working with Intel UHD Graphics 630.
BIOS settings like all the others you see around GITHUB and Dortania Guides.
SMBIOS for iMac20,1 - You can change S/N and type if you have i9 for instance set it to iMac20,2.
Not using Intel original Wifi car, swapped by native BCM94360NG.
Radeon RX 550 LP 4Gb, Yeston brand from Ali, Polaris, Native as well just added device-is FF67 and it worked out of the both including HDMI Audio.
Onboard Audio is ALC255 with layout 66.

Thanks to this forum and all Opencore team
